          G'day, my name is Scott O'Dea. I'm a 25 year-old aspiring developer
          and musician, who's graduated from the Fast-Track Bootcamp at Coder
          Academy Sydney. <br /> <br />
          Finding a great synergy between my personality and coding, I'm looking
          forward to a career as a full-stack developer.
